# ICC2 is normally a two-step process.
#   1. Library Manager (this flow):
#       - Provide libraries from PDK, including: *.db files, which are binary encoded versions
#         of library files that contain cell timing, delay, parasitics;
#         FRAM views, which are abstracted versions of the layout so the tool knows
#         where the pins and metal blockages are; and most importantly, the Technology file (*.tf)
#         which provides the technology description like an available layers/vias 
#         list including visible info (color, pattern), design rules of
#         width, spacing, and pitch, unit length, voltage, current, power, precision and
#         unit resistance and capacitance of layers, maximum current density of vias, etc.
#         The library manager then takes these input files and rules, and compiles them 
#         into a New Data Model (*.ndm) file which is what the ICC2 tool expects as an input
#   2. ICC2:
#       - Once your libraries are compiled into a *.ndm, the ICC2 tool can be run. See apr.tcl for 
#         information about the ICC2 flow
