# This script is the "master-script" which sources all the other .tcl files.
# The construction flow is in-line with the material covered in the lecture:
# Data/Library, synthesis netlist read-in:: floorplanning :: placement :: clock_tree
# routing :: chip_finishing :: data_preparation
# This spar script is what you will use to *** tape out your final design ****
# Some instructions:
# 1. Please go through it carefully, step by step. Hopefully for some of you, your experiences
#    with tutorial 1 and tutorial 2 will have convinced you of the value in doing this
# 2. Treat 03_powerplan.tcl as a black box. There's a lot of detail and other files hiding underneath that do
#    not offer sufficient value to you guys. Your time (IMO) is better spent focusing on other more 
#    important aspects of the design process.
# 3. This flow is not a "2-level" flow. This scripts will call other .tcl files, which will call
#    other .py, .tcl files. The only exception is the pinPlacement.txt file which is how you specify 
#    pin locations in your design.

# This file defines the file paths to the libraries we use in APR 
# Most of these (but not all) are unused in apr.tcl - they are used to generate the .ndm,
# which is essentially a compressed version of your library in a common synopsys format,
# using a different tool (library manager). We provide the .ndm to you as it only needs to be generated once.
# The details of the .ndm generation can be found in library_manager.tcl
